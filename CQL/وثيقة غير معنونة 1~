CQL:Cassandra Query Language
    is teh primary interface to the Cassandra DBMS: cqlsh, DevCenter, native drivers
    . Modeleted after SQL for familiarity
    . Data definition and manipulation languge (DDL and DML)
     create, alter, grant, revoke, drop,use
     seletct, insert update delete truncate batch
     . data types [ blob, boolean, decimal, double, float, int, text, varchar, timestamp, uuid, timeuuid, counter
     . set, list, map [cassandra parition)
     .No table joins -> Query driven design
     
     
CQLsh: is an interactive utility
 cdqlsh [optins] [host [port]]
 
  -k
  -f [file_name]
  -u [user] - [password]
  
  . CQL shell is a Cassandra capability, not restricted to cqlsh
  . CQL shell command may only be used with cqlsh
  
 Command
     CAPTURE, CONSISTENCY, COPY, EXIT, SHOW, SOURCE, TRACING
     
     /usr/bin/cqlsh  ; launch cqlsh

     from the directory the cqlsh is launched from.
     
     use the show and describe commands to get info about
     node
     show host;
     show version;
     describe keyspaces;
     describe keyspace musicdb;
     describe tables;
     use musicdb;
     describe tablename;
